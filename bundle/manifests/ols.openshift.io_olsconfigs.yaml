                                The profiles are intent based, so they may change over time as new ciphers are developed and existing ciphers
                                are found to be insecure.  Depending on precisely which ciphers are available to a process, the list may be
                                reduced.

                                Note that the Modern profile is currently not supported because it is not
                                yet well adopted by common software libraries.
