# Go Code Review

## Quick Reference

| Issue Type | Reference |
|------------|-----------|
| Missing error checks, wrapped errors | [references/error-handling.md](references/error-handling.md) |
| Race conditions, channel misuse | [references/concurrency.md](references/concurrency.md) |
| Interface pollution, naming | [references/interfaces.md](references/interfaces.md) |
| Resource leaks, defer misuse | [references/common-mistakes.md](references/common-mistakes.md) |

## Review Checklist

- [ ] All errors are checked (no `_ = err`)
- [ ] Errors wrapped with context (`fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`)
- [ ] Resources closed with `defer` immediately after creation
- [ ] No goroutine leaks (channels closed, contexts canceled)
- [ ] Interfaces defined by consumers, not producers
- [ ] Interface names end in `-er` (Reader, Writer, Handler)
- [ ] Exported names have doc comments
- [ ] No naked returns in functions > 5 lines
- [ ] Context passed as first parameter
- [ ] Mutexes protect shared state, not methods

### Kubernetes Operator Specific

- [ ] Owner references set with `controllerutil.SetControllerReference()`
- [ ] Finalizers added/removed safely (check for DeletionTimestamp)
- [ ] Context propagated through reconcile loops
- [ ] Client errors handled (distinguish NotFound vs other errors)
- [ ] Status updates separate from spec changes
- [ ] Resource watching pattern: Owned resources tracked via ResourceVersion, external resources use explicit watchers (see `internal/controller/watchers/`)
- [ ] Reconcile functions are idempotent (safe to call multiple times)
- [ ] Resource updates check semantic equality first (`apiequality.Semantic.DeepEqual`)
- [ ] Return `ctrl.Result{Requeue: true}` for transient issues, errors for permanent failures
- [ ] RBAC markers (`//+kubebuilder:rbac`) present for all resource access in controllers

## Review Questions

1. Are all error returns checked and wrapped?
2. Are goroutines properly managed with context cancellation?
3. Are resources (files, connections) closed with defer?
4. Are interfaces minimal and defined where used?

## Valid Patterns (Do NOT Flag)

These patterns are acceptable and should NOT be flagged as issues:

- **`_ = err` with reason comment** - Intentionally ignored errors with explanation
  ```go
  _ = conn.Close() // Best effort cleanup, already handling primary error
  ```
- **Empty interface `interface{}`** - For truly generic code (pre-generics codebases)
- **Naked returns in short functions** - Acceptable in functions < 5 lines with named returns
- **Channel without close** - When consumer stops via context cancellation, not channel close
- **Mutex protecting struct fields** - Even if accessed only via methods, this is correct encapsulation
- **`//nolint` directives with reason** - Acceptable when accompanied by explanation
  ```go
  //nolint:errcheck // Error logged but not returned per API contract
  ```
- **Defer in loop** - When function scope cleanup is intentional (e.g., processing files in batches)

## Context-Sensitive Rules

Only flag these issues when the specific conditions apply:

| Issue | Flag ONLY IF |
|-------|--------------|
| Missing error check | Error return is actionable (can retry, log, or propagate) |
| Goroutine leak | No context cancellation path exists for the goroutine |
| Missing defer | Resource isn't explicitly closed before next acquisition or return |
| Interface pollution | Interface has > 1 method AND only one consumer exists |
